# twitter-data-analysis
An analysis of data retrieved through the Twitter API 

This will be a project in cooperation with @enceladosaurus to pull and analyze Twitter user data. Currently, the plan is to look for correlation between Twitter users' perceived* political leaning and COVID messaging. Although still at the conceptual stage, this project will continue to evolve as we examine the data and begin to unpack what is there/observable. Metholodogy will be more robustly documented once the initial shape of the analysis is determined. 

*metrics of "perceived" are being determined, but may initially be drawn from news sources followed or engagement with certain political pages.
